## Camera Calibration
Camera calibration is a fundamental step in **3D vision**, as it estimates the intrinsic parameters required to accurately project 3D points onto a 2D image plane.  
A complete, step-by-step guideline for camera calibration is available [here](https://github.com/gitmehrdad/3D-Vision/tree/main/Camera%20Calibration).
